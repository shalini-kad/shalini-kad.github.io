    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the mobile applications developed by <strong>Shalini Kadavill</strong>. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Our applications are designed with privacy in mind. Unless otherwise stated within the specific app's settings, we do not collect, store, or transmit personal identifiable information. Any data created within the application stays locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our applications may utilize standard Apple services (such as iCloud for synchronization or App Analytics). Data handled by these services is governed by Apple’s Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>3. Account Deletion & Data Retention</h2>
    <p>If an application offers account creation, users may delete their account and all associated data directly via the in-app settings. For applications without accounts, deleting the app from your device will remove all locally stored data. You may also contact us for data-related inquiries.</p>

    <h2>4. Consent</h2>
    <p>By using our applications, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>
