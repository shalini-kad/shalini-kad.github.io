    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Our applications are designed with privacy in mind. Unless otherwise stated, we do not collect, store, or transmit personal identifiable information to our own servers. However, user-created designs (sketches) are transmitted to a third-party service for processing as described in Section 2. Any other data created within the application stays locally on your device</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p><b>Third Party AI Services:</b> Our application uses the Google Gemini API to refine and generate the AI music. While we do not store your data on our own servers, your prompts are transmitted to Google to provide the service.We use the Paid API tier, which ensures your data is not used for AI model training. </p>

    <p><b>No Third-Party Analytics:</b> We do not use third-party analytics software (such as Firebase or Google Analytics) that collects device identifiers.

    <p><b>No Advertising:</b> Our apps do not contain third-party advertising.</p>

    <p> <b>Apple Services:</b> We may use standard Apple-provided services (such as iCloud). These are governed by Apple’s Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>3. Account Deletion & Data Retention</h2>
    <p>If an application offers account creation, users may delete their account and all associated data directly via the in-app settings. For applications without accounts, deleting the app from your device will remove all locally stored data. You may also contact us for data-related inquiries.</p>

    <h2>4. Consent</h2>
    <p>By using our applications, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>
